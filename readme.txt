```php
// Modify generation options
add_filter('post_takeaways_generation_options', function($options) {
    $options['max_length'] = 300;
    return $options;
});

// Customize summary display
add_filter('post_takeaways_summary_html', function($html, $summary) {

}, 10, 2);

// Hook into generation process
add_action('post_takeaways_summary_generated', function($post_id, $summary) {
    // Custom logic
